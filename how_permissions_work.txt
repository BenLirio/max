Every file on a computer has permissions.

Each file has seperate permissions for 'Read', 'Write', and 'Execute'

For example, if you are reading this file right now, then this file has 'Read' permissions.

For me to type out this file, I had to have 'Write' permision.

To execute the command 'zork' you must have 'Execute' permission to the file 'zork'.

### How to view a files permissions ###

To view the permisions of the files in your folder type
$ ls -l
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ben ben  159 Jan 11 00:38 README.txt
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^
This means that the file README.txt has permisions '-rw-rw-r--'
Wait, but what does that mean?

After ignoring the first '-', you can split the output into three sections
'rw-' 'rw-' and 'r--'
Each of contain 3 letters that stands for permissions.
The first 'rw-' stands for Read and Write.
The last 'r--' stands for just Read.
If a file had only execute permisions it would look like '--x'

But why are there three?
They stand for the different types of users on the computer.
The three types are User, Group, Other.

User: The person who owns the file, (Max).
Group: Similar to family member (Papa).
Other: Similar to guest (Owen).

Pretend you had a private journal on the computer, then you may want the permissions to be
'rw-' for you
'---' for Group and Other

Here are some more examples:

Example 1:
-rwx---r--
User has Read, Write, Execute
Group has None
Other has Read

Example 2:
-r--r--r--
Anyone can Read the file but no one can Write or Execute it.

### How to change permissions ###

I am busy right now, but if you want to know in the future let me know and I can explain.
